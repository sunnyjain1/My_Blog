# My_Blog

This is a simple blog site using django, python, bootstrap, html ,css.

The blog is not fully formed. I m still working on it. Soon will update with more features. It consists of just basic implementations.

To run the project, Clone the project to your computer.

Go to My_Blog directory using command shell.

Write command "./manage.py runserver" it will run the server on your local host with default port set to 8000.

You can change the port by writing the command as "./manage.py runserver 8080". It will run the server on the local host using 8080 port.

After running the server open your browser and enter the link localhost:8000 and finally you can see the blog.
