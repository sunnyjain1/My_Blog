# My_Blog

### Detail 

This is a simple blog site using django, python, bootstrap, html ,css.

The blog is not fully formed. I m still working on it. Soon will update with more features. It consists of just basic implementations.

### How to Run

To run the project, Clone the project to your computer.

Go to My_Blog directory using command shell.

You should install the required softwares. This project contains requirements.txt which consists of all the required software and libraries to run the project. To install just write **pip install -r requirements.txt** . I would refer you to use a virtual environment for this.

After installing write command **./manage.py runserver** it will run the server on your local host with default port set to **8000**.

You can change the port by writing the command as **./manage.py runserver 8080**. It will run the server on the local host using **8080** port.

After running the server open your browser and enter the link **localhost:8000** and then you can browse just like other websites. 

###### Note: Do not use browser back button to browse.
